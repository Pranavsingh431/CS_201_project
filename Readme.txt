We are submitting two codes

In one of them we implemented the normal quad tree which searches if a node is present in the tree or not.
In second we implemented our version of the quad tree where we will find the nearest node to our inputted point.

For second code(our implementation)

then in each line we enter the x co ordinate then the y co ordinate and then the name of city
