We are submitting two codes

In one of them we implemented the normal quad tree which searches if a node is present in the tree or not.
In second we implemented our version of the quad tree where we will find the nearest node to our inputted point.

For second code(our implementation)
first input the number of cities we want to enter
then in each line we enter the x co ordinate then the y co ordinate and then the name of city

once you are done inputting all cities
type the co ordinates from which u need the nearest city or when specified certin radius, we can search within that given radius too.

To simulate a real life scenario, we have provided a file named input.txt in the same repository which a user can use as an input in the code.

The output will give us the nearest city to the point you inputted and also search cities within certain radius.
